Both jvi and nbvi should be checked out of the CVS repository, and they should
reside in the same directory.

To build everything, open nbvi/nbvi-suite (yes, I know its backwards) and
build it.

jvi is the platform independent code. It is referenced from the free form
project nbvi/nbvi-suite/jvi-project. jvi-project is wrapped by the module
jvi-wrapper. nbvi is the module that interface jVi to NetBeans. The nbvi
module's display name is "jVi KeyBindings" and jvi-wrapper's display name is
"jVi Core".

jvi-wrapper and nbvi are contained in nbvi-suite. The clean and build targets
on jvi-wrapper are modified to clean/build jvi-project.
