Both jvi and nbvi should be checked out of the Mercurial repository, and they 
should reside in the same directory.

To build everything with NetBeans, open nbvi/nbvi-suite (yep, its backwards)
and build it using the target "Create NBMs". jvi-project can be built and run 
as a standalone app for debugging jVi internals.

jvi is the platform independent code. It is referenced from the free form
project nbvi/nbvi-suite/jvi-project. jvi-project is wrapped by the module
jvi-wrapper. nbvi is the module that interface jVi to NetBeans. The nbvi
module's display name is "jVi KeyBindings" and jvi-wrapper's display name is
"jVi Core".

jvi-wrapper and nbvi are contained in nbvi-suite. The clean and build targets
on jvi-wrapper are modified to clean/build jvi-project.
