Both jvi and nbvi should be checked out of the Mercurial repository, and they 
should reside in the same directory.

To build almost everything with NetBeans, open nbvi (aka nbvi-suite)
and build it with "Build All". If you want to install it, you'll need the
NBMs; run target "Package as > NBMs" and look in nbvi/build/updates.

nbvi-module (aka jVi for NetBeans) is the module that interfaces jVi to
NetBeans. This is all NetBeans code (a few features that should be
split/refactored to the jVi project).

jvi-wrapper (aka jVi Core) is a module wrapper for the standalone, independent
of NetBeans, jVi project. Clean and build on the wrapper, do clean and build
on the project.

NB-jVi-SPI is an encapsulation of some NetBeans access though either reflection
or patching

There are some additional modules that can be built and installed.

jvi-help is a placeholder for future work.

NOTE: patch-windows is no longer needed.
patch-windows is a module suite that patches the NetBeans IDE. Its installation
is optional. It provides support for resizing an editor window. It is used
by jVi to set the size of a window as part of a window split/move and to
implement the window resize commands.
