Both jvi and nbvi should be checked out of the Mercurial repository, and they 
should reside in the same directory, eg jvi-srcdir.

You can run nbvi (jVi in NB) from NB or use NB to build the modules needed to
install jVi in NetBeans. Open
        <srcdir>/nbvi                (nbvi-suite)
        <srcdir>/nbvi/NBjVi-SPI
        <srcdir>/nbvi/jvi-help
You can also open the following, but shouldn't be needed
        <scrdir>/nbvi/nbvi-module    (jVi for NetBeans)
        <scrdir>/nbvi/jvi-wrapper    (jVi Core)
        
And note that <srcdir>/jvi can be opened; it is a plain old java project.  It
gets wrapped. It has the core jVi sources.  It can be run and gives a
standalone/debug jVi (with no netbeans).

To build jVi with NetBeans, first build modules NB-jVi-SPI and jViHelp. Then
you can RUN or DEBUG nbvi-suite; this starts up a copy of NB with jVi. This is 
all done from within NetBeans. FYI, if you look at properties for nbvi-suite
you will see that under properties>Libraries, jViHelp and NB-jVi-SPI are
added to the platform.

If you want to install jVi, you'll need the NBMs; run target
"Package as > NBMs" and look in nbvi/build/updates. You'll also need the
modules for NB-jVi-SPI and jvi-help

nbvi-module (aka jVi for NetBeans) is the module that interfaces jVi to
NetBeans. This is all NetBeans code (a few features that should be
split/refactored to the jVi project).

jvi-wrapper (aka jVi Core) is a module wrapper for the standalone, independent
of NetBeans, jVi project. Clean and build on the wrapper, do clean and build
on the project.

NB-jVi-SPI is an encapsulation of some NetBeans access though either reflection
or patching

There are some additional modules that can be built and installed.

jvi-help is a placeholder for future work.

NOTE: patch-windows is no longer needed.
patch-windows is a module suite that patches the NetBeans IDE. Its installation
is optional. It provides support for resizing an editor window. It is used
by jVi to set the size of a window as part of a window split/move and to
implement the window resize commands.
