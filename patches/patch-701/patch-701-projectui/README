This is FavoritesSlowPerformance.diff

    Without this patch, a context menu on a Favorites may hang
    waiting for some stuff to happen, e.g. after expanding b/main

It does not include Bundle.properties which were editted to remove stuff
that now uses @Messages. The @Messages usage changes the bundle names
to avoid conflict since they appear in the original bundle.
This may not work well.
